# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware


## Marlin 2.0 Bugfix Branch

__Not for production use. Use with caution!__

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level with support for much faster 32-bit processor boards.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.0.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.0.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.9](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on how to [build Marlin 2.0 for ARM](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arm.html).

## Flashing only works on the QQ with disconnected MKS TFT or with USB Conncted only without Power turned on. MKS TFT interferes with the Flashing of the Firmware

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
